                    In this article, Christine Benz with Morningstar
                    discusses this complex issue a lot of clients face.
                    Like it or not, there's a good chance that a high-deductible
                    healthcare
                    plan, along with a health savings account, will be coming
                    your way during

                    and worry over
                    different economic and social events, and how these
                    events will affect
                    the outcome of investment returns. Some events are worse
                    than others,
