                    <span>What should I expect when creating a financial plan?</span>
                        <span>
                            A full comprehensive plan discussing first and foremost what
                            current topcis are impportant to you. My plan's are fairly
                            simple and easy to understand. My plans are not 80 to 120 pages
                            with 6 or 7 modulels being covered all at one time, unless it is
                            absolutlley necessary. Rather, I focus on what is important to
                            you (retirement, college savings, second home purchase) and show
                            the likelyhood of you being able to obtain these goals. I am
                            able to cover this in 20 to 30 pages. I then come back and
                            discuss other topicis such as insurance, that may not be highest
                            on the priority list, when we first engage.

                    Does your advisory fee cover the cost of financial planning
                    and other items?
                </span>
                    <span>
                        My fees are comprehensive and include financial and goal
                        planning,
                        along with ongoing advice. If a third party asset manager or
                        other products such as mutual funds or ETF's are implemented,
                        there are costs associated with these in addition to the
                        quarterly advisory fee.
